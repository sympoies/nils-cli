A Rust workspace of focused CLI binaries for API testing, Git operations, agent workflow evidence, provider automation, planning, and
desktop/media utilities. Shared crates keep JSON contracts, terminal UX, and cross-CLI behavior consistent.

## Automation-first contract

Interactive human use remains supported, while agents and system automation are
first-class consumers. Automation-facing commands publish versioned JSON
envelopes, stable machine error codes, deterministic exit status, and bounded,
privacy-safe diagnostics. Recoverable failures expose retryability and the next
action structurally; callers never parse prose to choose recovery behavior.

## CLI surface map

Start here when choosing a binary. The source of truth for the current installable binary list is:

```bash
bash scripts/workspace-bins.sh
```

Completion obligations for those binaries are tracked in
[docs/specs/completion-coverage-matrix-v1.md](docs/specs/completion-coverage-matrix-v1.md).

| Git tooling | `git-scope`, `git-cli`, `git-summary`, `git-lock` | Inspect changes, run Git helper flows, summarize commits, or manage repo-local commit locks. |
| Forge automation | `forge-cli`, `github-app-cli` | Drive PR/MR + Issue lifecycle and repository label catalog maintenance on GitHub (via `gh`) or GitLab (via `glab`), or mint GitHub App installation tokens. |
| Agent policy and evidence | `agent-runtime`, `agent-docs`, `agent-hook`, `agent-memory`, `agent-out`, `agent-session`, `main-agent`, `agent-scope-lock`, `agent-run`, `test-first-evidence`, `web-evidence`, `browser-session`, `canary-check`, `docs-impact`, `heuristic-inbox`, `model-cross-check`, `repo-retro`, `review-evidence`, `review-specialists`, `skill-usage`, `evidence` | Render/install/audit runtime-kit surfaces, resolve agent policy docs, dispatch one shared cross-provider hook policy, manage local agent memory stores, run project commands through explicit env handling, allocate artifact paths, start tmux-backed agent sessions, operate durable Main Agent and interactive worker lifecycles, enforce edit scope, inspect repo retrospectives, merge specialist review evidence, persist deterministic workflow evidence, or migrate and query the durable skill-usage evidence archive. |
| Planning and delivery | `plan-tooling`, `plan-issue`, `plan-issue-local`, `plan-archive`, `semantic-commit` | Validate/split implementation plans, orchestrate issue delivery, rehearse local plan flows, query archived plans, or run validated commit workflows. |
| Provider lanes | `codex-cli`, `gemini-cli`, `claude-cli`, `opencode-cli` | Run provider-specific diagnostics, auth checks, and workflow adapters. |
| Markdown rendering | `md-render` | Render `.md.tera` templates from JSON view data through the shared `nils-markdown` engine. |
| Desktop, media, and local utilities | `docker-tools`, `macos-agent`, `screen-record`, `image-processing`, `fzf-cli`, `memo`, `secrets`, `zsh-kit` | Operate containers, automate desktop tasks, capture or convert media, use interactive shell helpers, manage the encrypted environment store, record/search local memos, or bootstrap an operator-supplied Zsh repository at runtime. |
| Development-only/internal | `cli-template` | Validate packaging and new-crate patterns; excluded from user-facing completion obligations. |

- [crates/plan-archive](crates/plan-archive): Query and search interface for archived implementation-plan records.

## Shared helper policy (`nils-common`)

Contributors should treat `nils-common` as the shared helper boundary for cross-CLI primitives.

- Put reusable, domain-neutral helpers in [crates/nils-common](crates/nils-common).
- Keep crate-local adapters for user-facing copy, warning style, exit-code mapping, and CLI-specific UX policy.
- During migration, preserve parity by keeping output text/warnings/colors/exit behavior byte-for-byte stable.
- Characterize behavior with tests before moving helper logic, then re-run affected crate tests after migration.

Detailed scope, API examples, migration conventions, and non-goals are documented in
[crates/nils-common/README.md](crates/nils-common/README.md).

Finalized shared-crate boundary and extraction lane ownership are tracked in
[docs/specs/workspace-shared-crate-boundary-v1.md](docs/specs/workspace-shared-crate-boundary-v1.md).

Workspace doc retention scope and delete/keep decisions are tracked in
[docs/specs/workspace-doc-retention-matrix-v1.md](docs/specs/workspace-doc-retention-matrix-v1.md).

## Shell wrappers and completions

Canonical completion architecture and contributor validation live in
[docs/runbooks/cli-completion-development-standard.md](docs/runbooks/cli-completion-development-standard.md). Use
[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for required delivery checks.

Completion obligation coverage is tracked in
[docs/specs/completion-coverage-matrix-v1.md](docs/specs/completion-coverage-matrix-v1.md).

Assets:

- [completions/zsh/](completions/zsh/): zsh completions (plus `aliases.zsh`)
- [completions/bash/](completions/bash/): bash completions (plus `aliases.bash`)
- [wrappers/](wrappers/): dev-only wrapper scripts

Local shell setup:

1. Zsh: add [completions/zsh/](completions/zsh/) to your `fpath`, then run `compinit` in your shell init.
2. Zsh (optional): `source completions/zsh/aliases.zsh` (see [completions/zsh/aliases.zsh](completions/zsh/aliases.zsh))
3. Bash: copy `completions/bash/<command>` into your bash-completion directory, or source them from your shell init.
4. Bash (optional): `source completions/bash/aliases.bash` (see [completions/bash/aliases.bash](completions/bash/aliases.bash))
5. Dev-only: add [wrappers/](wrappers/) to your PATH (or symlink wrapper scripts into a bin directory).

## Local install from source

Build release binaries into the default local bin directory:

```bash
./scripts/install-local-release-binaries.sh
```

Install only a specific binary:

```bash
./scripts/install-local-release-binaries.sh --bin git-scope
```

The default destination is `~/.local/nils-cli/bin`; add it to `PATH` when needed:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/nils-cli/bin:$PATH"
```

## GitHub Releases

Prebuilt release tarballs are published from `v*` tags after CI verifies the
tagged commit. Download the matching `nils-cli-<tag>-<target>.tar.gz` asset from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sympoies/nils-cli/releases), extract it,
and add `<extract_dir>/bin` to your `PATH`.

Release archives include the compiled binaries, shell completions, aliases,
license file, and third-party license/notice artifacts. After extracting release
assets, follow the same setup flow from
["Shell wrappers and completions"](#shell-wrappers-and-completions).

## Development and maintainer workflows

Use [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for maintenance principles and the routine
workflow. Detailed setup, validation lanes, generated artifacts, release
maintenance, and crates.io publishing live in the
[workspace maintenance reference](docs/runbooks/workspace-maintenance-reference.md).

New CLI crate onboarding is documented in
[docs/runbooks/new-cli-crate-development-standard.md](docs/runbooks/new-cli-crate-development-standard.md).
