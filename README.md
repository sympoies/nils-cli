# nils-cli

[![CI](https://github.com/graysurf/nils-cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/graysurf/nils-cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Coverage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graysurf/nils-cli/coverage-badge/badges/coverage.svg)](https://github.com/graysurf/nils-cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/graysurf/nils-cli?sort=semver)](https://github.com/graysurf/nils-cli/releases) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

A Rust workspace of focused CLI binaries for Git operations, API test orchestration, and workflow automation, unified by shared cross-crate helpers.

## Workspace layout

Each crate is either a standalone CLI binary or a shared library used across the workspace.

### Shared foundations

- [crates/nils-common](crates/nils-common): Shared cross-CLI utilities (including markdown payload validation and markdown-table canonicalization helpers).
- [crates/nils-term](crates/nils-term): Terminal UX helpers (TTY detection + progress rendering on stderr).
- [crates/nils-test-support](crates/nils-test-support): Test-only helpers for deterministic workspace integration tests.
- [crates/cli-template](crates/cli-template): Minimal example CLI for validating packaging and new-crate patterns.

### API testing stack

- [crates/api-testing-core](crates/api-testing-core): Shared library for the API testing CLIs (config/auth, history, reporting).
- [crates/api-rest](crates/api-rest): REST request runner from JSON request specs, with history + Markdown reports.
- [crates/api-gql](crates/api-gql): GraphQL operation runner for `.graphql` files (variables, history, reports, schema).
- [crates/api-grpc](crates/api-grpc): gRPC request runner from JSON specs, with history + Markdown reports.
- [crates/api-websocket](crates/api-websocket): Deterministic WebSocket request runner with history + Markdown reports.
- [crates/api-test](crates/api-test): Suite runner that orchestrates REST/GraphQL/gRPC/WebSocket cases and outputs JSON (and optional JUnit).

### Git tooling

- [crates/git-scope](crates/git-scope): Git change inspector (tracked/staged/unstaged/untracked/commit) with tree + optional file printing.
- [crates/git-cli](crates/git-cli): Git tools dispatcher (utils/reset/commit/branch/ci/open).
- [crates/git-summary](crates/git-summary): Per-author contribution summaries over a date range (adds/dels/net/commits).
- [crates/git-lock](crates/git-lock): Label-based commit locks per repo (lock/list/diff/unlock/tag).

### Automation and utility CLIs

- [crates/macos-agent](crates/macos-agent): macOS desktop automation primitives for app/window discovery, input actions, screenshot, and wait helpers.
- [crates/fzf-cli](crates/fzf-cli): Interactive `fzf` toolbox for files, Git, processes, ports, and shell history.
- [crates/memo-cli](crates/memo-cli): Capture-first memo workflow CLI with agent enrichment loop (`add`, `list`, `search`, `report`, `fetch`, `apply`).
- [crates/image-processing](crates/image-processing): Batch image transformation CLI (resize/crop/optimize) with JSON/report outputs.
- [crates/screen-record](crates/screen-record): macOS ScreenCaptureKit + Linux (X11) recorder for a single window or display with optional audio.

### Agent and workflow tooling

- [crates/agent-docs](crates/agent-docs): Deterministic policy-document resolver for Codex/agent workflows (`resolve`, `contexts`, `add`, `baseline`).
- [crates/codex-cli](crates/codex-cli): Provider-specific CLI for OpenAI/Codex workflows (auth, diagnostics, execution wrappers, Starship), with adapters over `nils-common::provider_runtime`.
- [crates/gemini-cli](crates/gemini-cli): Provider-specific CLI lane for Gemini workflows, with adapters over `nils-common::provider_runtime`.
- [crates/semantic-commit](crates/semantic-commit): Helper CLI for generating staged context and creating semantic commits.
- [crates/plan-tooling](crates/plan-tooling): Plan Format v1 tooling CLI (`to-json`, `validate`, `batches`, `split-prs`, `scaffold`, `completion`), with `split-prs` emitting deterministic grouping primitives.
- [crates/plan-issue-cli](crates/plan-issue-cli): Plan issue orchestration binaries (`plan-issue`, `plan-issue-local`) where `Task Decomposition` is runtime truth, sprint artifacts are derived outputs, and runtime lane metadata is materialized from plan content + split-prs grouping results.

## Shared helper policy (`nils-common`)

Contributors should treat `nils-common` as the shared helper boundary for cross-CLI primitives.

- Put reusable, domain-neutral helpers in [crates/nils-common](crates/nils-common).
- Keep crate-local adapters for user-facing copy, warning style, exit-code mapping, and CLI-specific UX policy.
- During migration, preserve parity by keeping output text/warnings/colors/exit behavior byte-for-byte stable.
- Characterize behavior with tests before moving helper logic, then re-run affected crate tests after migration.

Detailed scope, API examples, migration conventions, and non-goals are documented in
[crates/nils-common/README.md](crates/nils-common/README.md).

## Shell wrappers and completions

Canonical completion architecture and contributor validation live in
[docs/runbooks/cli-completion-development-standard.md](docs/runbooks/cli-completion-development-standard.md).
Use [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for required delivery checks.

Assets:

- [completions/zsh/](completions/zsh/): zsh completions (plus `aliases.zsh`)
- [completions/bash/](completions/bash/): bash completions (plus `aliases.bash`)
- [wrappers/](wrappers/): dev-only wrapper scripts
- [wrappers/plan-issue-delivery-loop.sh](wrappers/plan-issue-delivery-loop.sh): compatibility wrapper that delegates to `plan-issue`

Local shell setup:

1. Zsh: add [completions/zsh/](completions/zsh/) to your `fpath`, then run `compinit` in your shell init.
2. Zsh (optional): `source completions/zsh/aliases.zsh` (see [completions/zsh/aliases.zsh](completions/zsh/aliases.zsh))
3. Bash: copy `completions/bash/<command>` into your bash-completion directory, or source them from your shell init.
4. Bash (optional): `source completions/bash/aliases.bash` (see [completions/bash/aliases.bash](completions/bash/aliases.bash))
5. Dev-only: add [wrappers/](wrappers/) to your PATH (or symlink wrapper scripts into a bin directory).

## Contributor checks

Use [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) as the canonical checklist.

- Full required checks: `./.agents/skills/nils-cli-verify-required-checks/scripts/nils-cli-verify-required-checks.sh`
- Docs-only fast path: `./.agents/skills/nils-cli-verify-required-checks/scripts/nils-cli-verify-required-checks.sh --docs-only`

## Local install (release)

- Build + install all workspace binaries into `~/.local/nils-cli/`:
  - `./.agents/skills/nils-cli-install-local-release-binaries/scripts/nils-cli-install-local-release-binaries.sh`
- Install only a specific binary:
  - `./.agents/skills/nils-cli-install-local-release-binaries/scripts/nils-cli-install-local-release-binaries.sh --bin git-scope`
- Add the install dir to `PATH` (example):
  - `export PATH="$HOME/.local/nils-cli:$PATH"`

## GitHub Releases (prebuilt binaries)

This repo can publish prebuilt tarballs via GitHub Releases for both:

- x86_64 (amd64)
- aarch64 (arm64)

To trigger a release build, push a tag like `v0.5.7`:

- `git tag -a v0.5.7 -m "v0.5.7"`
- `git push origin v0.5.7`

Then download the matching `nils-cli-<tag>-<target>.tar.gz` asset, extract it, and add
`<extract_dir>/bin` to your `PATH`.

Release packaging contract: shipped artifacts must include `completions/zsh/`, `completions/bash/`,
`completions/zsh/aliases.zsh`, and `completions/bash/aliases.bash`.
After extracting release assets, follow the same setup flow from
["Shell wrappers and completions"](#shell-wrappers-and-completions).

## crates.io publishing (shared crates)

Use `scripts/publish-crates.sh` for crate publishing flow.

- Default list + order: `release/crates-io-publish-order.txt`
- Dry-run (recommended first):
  - `scripts/publish-crates.sh --dry-run`
- Real publish:
  - `scripts/publish-crates.sh --publish`
- Override target crates:
  - `scripts/publish-crates.sh --crates "nils-term nils-common" --dry-run`

In `--dry-run` mode, the script runs `cargo publish --dry-run` for every selected crate.
In `--publish` mode, the script runs `dry-run -> publish` sequentially per crate (in your specified order).
By default, `--publish` skips crates that are already published at the same version on crates.io.

To query crates.io publish status (single/multi/all crates), use:

- `scripts/crates-io-status.sh --all --format text`
- `scripts/crates-io-status.sh --crates "nils-common nils-codex-cli" --version v0.3.1 --format json`
- `scripts/crates-io-status.sh --crate nils-codex-cli --format both --json-out "$AGENT_HOME/out/codex-status.json"`

`--version` checks that exact version; without `--version` the script checks each crate's current workspace version.
Use `--fail-on-missing` for CI gates.

GitHub Actions manual flow is also available at `.github/workflows/publish-crates.yml`:

- Trigger via `workflow_dispatch`.
- `mode=dry-run` runs checks only.
- `mode=publish` requires repository secret `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`.

## Adding a new CLI crate

Use the canonical onboarding runbook:
