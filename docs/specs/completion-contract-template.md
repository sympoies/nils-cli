# Completion Migration Contract Template

## Purpose
This template defines the per-CLI completion migration contract for clap-first rollout work.
Fill every required section so implementation, completion enforcement, and validation stay
deterministic across CLI migrations.

## Usage
1. Copy this file to the crate-local report path:
   - `crates/<crate>/docs/reports/<cli>-completion-migration-contract.md`
2. Replace placeholders with CLI-specific values.
3. Keep the contract updated through implementation and testing.
4. Link the contract path in PR notes before requesting review.

## Metadata
- CLI binary: `<cli>`
- Owning crate: `crates/<crate>`
- Contract owner: `<name>`
- Target PR: `<link-or-number>`
- Status: `draft|in-review|done`
- Last updated: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Completion enforcement metadata tuple from matrix row:
  - `completion_mode=<clap-first>`
  - `completion_mode_toggles=<forbidden>`
  - `alternate_completion_dispatch=<forbidden>`
  - `generated_load_failure=<fail-closed>`

## command graph (required)
Document the clap command tree used as the completion source of truth.

| command path | clap source | completion obligations | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<cli>` | `crates/<crate>/src/...` | root flags + top-level subcommands | `<notes>` |
| `<cli> <subcommand>` | `crates/<crate>/src/...` | subcommand flags/args/candidates | `<notes>` |

Checklist:
- [ ] Every supported subcommand path is listed.
- [ ] Long/short flags are represented by clap metadata.
- [ ] Hidden/deprecated paths are explicitly called out.

## value providers (required)
Document static and dynamic completion candidate sources.

| argument or flag | provider type (`ValueEnum`/`PossibleValue`/`ValueHint`/`CompleteEnv`/`__complete`) | source location | context-aware behavior | tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<flag-or-arg>` | `<provider>` | `crates/<crate>/src/...` | `<cursor-position rules>` | `<test path>` |

Rules:
- Value providers stay clap-first; dynamic providers extend the generated baseline only.
- Runtime data lookups must describe deterministic fallback behavior.

Checklist:
- [ ] No global candidate dump behavior remains.
- [ ] Cursor-position filtering is documented for dynamic value paths.

## alias map (required)
Document alias coverage and canonical command rewrites.

| alias | canonical command rewrite | zsh alias entry | bash alias entry | completion registration point |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<alias>` | `<canonical command>` | `completions/zsh/aliases.zsh` | `completions/bash/aliases.bash` | `completions/<shell>/<cli adapter>` |

Checklist:
- [ ] Alias entries are synced in both alias files, or `not required` is explicit.
- [ ] Adapter rewrite semantics are documented when aliases inject defaults.

## completion enforcement metadata (required)
Declare and validate metadata that enforces clap-first behavior and forbids runtime mode switches
or alternate completion dispatch paths. Values must match the CLI row in
`docs/reports/completion-coverage-matrix.md`.

| metadata key | required value | declared value | enforcement location | verification method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `completion_mode` | `clap-first` | `<value>` | `<path>` | `<proof>` |
| `completion_mode_toggles` | `forbidden` | `<value>` | `<path>` | `rg -n "COMPLETION_MODE" <paths>` |
| `alternate_completion_dispatch` | `forbidden` | `<value>` | `<path>` | `rg -n "alternate completion|fallback completer|old completion" <paths>` |
| `generated_load_failure` | `fail-closed` | `<value>` | `<path>` | `<completion test case>` |

Checklist:
- [ ] Declared metadata values match required values in this template.
- [ ] Declared metadata values match the matrix row for this CLI.
- [ ] Verification evidence includes completion-mode toggle and alternate dispatch checks.

## single-path invariants (required)
List invariants that enforce the metadata above and keep completion clap-first and fail closed.

| invariant | enforcement location | verification method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No runtime completion-mode toggles | `<path>` | `rg -n "COMPLETION_MODE" <paths>` |
| No alternate completion dispatch path | `<path>` | `rg -n "alternate completion|fallback completer|old completion" <paths>` |
| Generated-load failure fails closed (empty/no candidates) | `<path>` | `<completion test case>` |

Checklist:
- [ ] Adapters are thin (registration + optional dynamic hooks only).
- [ ] Generated-load failure does not route to alternate completion code.

## tests and validation (required)
Record command-level and repository-level checks for this migration.

### validation commands
1. `zsh -f tests/zsh/completion.test.zsh`
2. `zsh -n completions/zsh/_<cli>`
3. `bash -n completions/bash/<cli>`
4. `<cli> completion zsh | rg -- "--help|--version|--"`
5. `rg -n "COMPLETION_MODE|completion_mode_toggles|alternate_completion_dispatch|generated_load_failure" docs/reports/completion-coverage-matrix.md crates/<crate>/docs/reports/<cli>-completion-migration-contract.md`
6. `./.agents/skills/nils-cli-verify-required-checks/scripts/nils-cli-verify-required-checks.sh`
   - use `--docs-only` only when all changed files are docs.

### test coverage mapping
| requirement | test file or command | status (`pending|pass|fail`) | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| command graph candidates | `<path-or-command>` | `<status>` | `<notes>` |
| value providers | `<path-or-command>` | `<status>` | `<notes>` |
| alias map registration | `<path-or-command>` | `<status>` | `<notes>` |
| completion enforcement metadata | `<path-or-command>` | `<status>` | `<notes>` |
| single-path invariants | `<path-or-command>` | `<status>` | `<notes>` |

## acceptance criteria (required)
Mark all items before closing the migration.

- [ ] command graph matches implemented clap command surface.
- [ ] value providers cover required candidates and dynamic paths.
- [ ] alias map reflects zsh/bash alias entries and completion registration.
- [ ] completion enforcement metadata is declared, matches matrix policy, and is validated.
- [ ] single-path invariants are enforced and verified.
- [ ] tests and validation commands pass, with evidence captured.
- [ ] PR notes link this contract and summarize follow-up risk (if any).
