# Workspace Doc Retention Matrix v1

## Purpose

This matrix records finalized documentation ownership and retention decisions for the simplified
workspace architecture.

Decision fields:

- `scope`: `workspace-level` | `crate-local` | `transient-dev-record`
- `lifecycle`: `canonical` | `delete`
- `decision`: `keep` | `delete` | `move`

## Crate-Local Inventory (Keep)

All paths below are classified as `scope=crate-local`, `lifecycle=canonical`, `decision=keep`.
Rationale: each file is owned by one crate and lives under `crates/<crate>/docs/**`.

This section is the authoritative crate-local docs inventory. It MUST match the canonical find
output exactly:

```bash
find crates -type f -name '*.md' \
  -not -path '*/tests/*' \
  -not -path '*/src/*' \
  -not -path '*/assets/*' \
  -not -path 'crates/*/README.md' \
  -not -path 'crates/plan-tooling/plan-template.md'
```

Top-level `crates/<crate>/README.md` files and `crates/<crate>/docs/README.md` index files are
tracked separately in the [Crate Top-Level README Inventory](#crate-top-level-readme-inventory-keep)
below; the canonical `find` glob `crates/*/README.md` excludes any `README.md` under a crate root
because BSD-style `-path` lets `*` cross slash boundaries.

## Crate Top-Level README Inventory (Keep)

All paths below are classified as `scope=crate-local`, `lifecycle=canonical`, `decision=keep`.
Rationale: every workspace member crate ships a top-level `README.md` (rendered on crates.io and
as the GitHub crate-directory landing page) and a `docs/README.md` index for crate-local docs.
These files are excluded from the canonical Crate-Local Inventory `find` pattern, so they are
tracked here.

Top-level crate READMEs (one per workspace member, 46 total):

- `crates/agent-docs/README.md`
- `crates/agent-hook/README.md`
- `crates/agent-memory/README.md`

## Transient/Obsolete Inventory (Delete or Move)

All transient/obsolete entries previously tracked here have been removed from the working tree and
are kept off-tree by the `removed_transient_docs` allowlist in
`scripts/ci/docs-hygiene-audit.sh`. No active rows remain in this matrix.

If a new transient/obsolete artifact is added in the future, append it here with `scope`,
`lifecycle`, `decision`, `reason`, and an inbound-reference proof; update
`scripts/ci/docs-hygiene-audit.sh` to assert the file stays removed once delete is decided.
