# memo-cli Release Policy

## Publishable-first MVP policy
- `nils-memo-cli` follows a publishable-first policy for MVP.
- The first release target is crates.io, not an internal-only distribution.
- Rationale: memo capture and agent-inbox workflows need an install path that works outside this repository.

## Required crate metadata
- `crates/memo-cli/Cargo.toml` must remain crates.io-ready.
- Required package fields:
  - `name = "nils-memo-cli"`
  - `version = "<semver>"`
  - `description = "<crate summary>"`
  - `repository = "https://github.com/graysurf/nils-cli"`
- `publish = false` is forbidden for MVP and release candidates.

## Release order gate
- Release order is controlled by `release/crates-io-publish-order.txt`.
- `nils-memo-cli` must be listed in dependency-safe position:
  - after shared dependencies it consumes (for MVP: `nils-common`, `nils-term`)
  - before any future crates that depend on `nils-memo-cli`

## Dry-run verification gate
- Required publish readiness dry-run command:

```bash
scripts/publish-crates.sh --dry-run --crate nils-memo-cli
```

- Gate passes only when the command exits `0` and runs crate publish checks without metadata or ordering errors.
