# Workspace Maintenance Reference

Detailed command and operational reference for contributors maintaining
`nils-cli`. Start with the principles and routine workflow in
[`DEVELOPMENT.md`](../../DEVELOPMENT.md); use this runbook for:

- environment setup
- local test/check execution
- local development validation and CI delivery gates

For runtime dependency details and degradation behavior, see
[`BINARY_DEPENDENCIES.md`](../../BINARY_DEPENDENCIES.md).

## 1. Environment setup

### 1.1 Recommended bootstrap

Run once on a new machine:

```bash
scripts/setup-rust-tooling.sh
```

This installs/updates:

- rustup + cargo
- Rust components: `rustfmt`, `clippy`, `llvm-tools-preview`
- `cargo-nextest`
- `cargo-llvm-cov`

### 1.2 Minimum tools required for local checks

All local check flows assume `bash` is available to run repo scripts.

Docs-only checks require:

- `git`
- `npx`
- `plan-tooling`

Local fast changed-scope checks also require:

- `python3`
- `cargo` for non-document changes

CI/full parity checks also require:

- `cargo`
- `python3`
- `zsh`
- `rg`
- `cargo-nextest` when `NILS_CLI_TEST_RUNNER=nextest`

Coverage checks also require:

- `cargo-llvm-cov`
- `cargo-nextest`

For optional runtime tools used by individual CLIs, see `BINARY_DEPENDENCIES.md`.

## 2. Build and quick smoke checks

- Build workspace: `cargo build`
- Example CLI help checks:
  - `cargo run -p nils-cli-template -- --help`
  - `cargo run -p nils-git-scope -- --help`

### 2.1 Codex skill-surface shape checks

`agent-runtime doctor --class skill-surface --product codex` validates
install-map shape only. A passing shape check is not Codex Desktop acceptance;
live acceptance still requires `codex debug prompt-input` in a fresh Codex
Desktop session with `$HOME/.agents` absent and retired skill-related
environment variables unset. Rationale: see the archived plan bundle
`agent-plan-archive:plans/github.com/sympoies/nils-cli/2026-05-23-codex-skill-surface-primitives/`.

### 2.2 `agent-session` coordination changes

Before changing coordination behavior, read the crate-local
[`agent-session` documentation index](../../crates/agent-session/docs/README.md)
and the
[Session Coordination V1 contract](../../crates/agent-session/docs/specs/session-coordination-v1.md).
This repository owns the CLI, automatic presence, work-context, and protocol
contracts. `sympoies/agent-runtime-kit` owns the global agent policy and hook
consumer behavior.

Keep work authorization distinct from collision awareness: default `advisory`
coordination and unmanaged sessions require no claim and never deny work;
`work-context set` only improves overlap metadata; strict claim/admission
semantics apply only to an explicit `enforce` launch. Changes to that boundary
require coupled nils-cli/runtime-kit validation.

### 2.3 Agent- and system-facing CLI UX

Treat agents and system automation as first-class CLI consumers while keeping
interactive text mode clear for humans. For new or touched automation-facing
failures, contributors must:

- preserve the exact versioned schema and evolve it additively within a schema
  version;
- publish a stable machine error code with deterministic exit status;
- expose typed `error.details.retryable`, `error.details.next_action`, and a
  bounded `error.details.recovery` object on recoverable touched paths;
- derive clear text output from the same typed failure model;
- bound and redact diagnostic fields, excluding secrets, raw session IDs,
  absolute local state or project paths, private content, and command dumps;
- require automation to branch on structured fields, never `message` or
  `hint`;
- cover representative failures, field types, exit status, and leakage in
  contract tests.

This contract applies to new or touched automation-facing failures. Existing
CLIs are audited incrementally; the first bounded implementation covers
`agent-docs session` errors rather than claiming a workspace-wide migration is
already complete.

## 3. Canonical validation flows

Local development defaults to changed-scope validation. The full workspace test
stack and coverage gate are CI responsibilities for normal PRs; run them
locally only when you need CI parity, release-quality verification, coverage
maintenance, or explicit debugging evidence.

Primary local entrypoint for day-to-day implementation work:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/nils-cli-checks-entrypoint.sh --local-fast
```

This runs changed-scope validation against `origin/main` by default:

- documentation-only changes use the docs-only lane
- non-shared crate changes run package-scoped `fmt`, `clippy`, and tests
- shared crates and workspace-level files escalate to the workspace Rust gate
- the workspace lane runs its tests through `scripts/ci/tempdir-leak-probe.sh`,
  which fails on temp directories the suite leaves behind; see
  `docs/specs/test-temp-directory-policy.md`
- a package-scoped lane does not build binaries another package owns, so a test
  that needs one skips with a reason naming the build command; see
  `bin::sibling_or_skip` in `crates/nils-test-support`. Build the sibling — for
  example `cargo build -p nils-gemini-cli --bins` — to run those tests locally.
  A *stale* sibling fails instead of skipping, because an artifact from an
  earlier release is an operator error rather than a property of the run. The
  workspace lane and CI build every default-feature binary, and CI additionally
  sets `NILS_TEST_REQUIRE_SIBLING_BINS=1` so a skip there is a hard failure
  rather than a silent loss of coverage

Override the base ref when needed:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/nils-cli-checks-entrypoint.sh --local-fast --base main
```

Use `--plan-only` to inspect the selected validation scope without running it:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/nils-cli-checks-entrypoint.sh --local-fast --plan-only
```

The canonical CI/full-check entrypoint remains:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/nils-cli-checks-entrypoint.sh
```

This delegates to `./.agents/skills/project-verify-required-checks/scripts/project-verify-required-checks.sh`.
It is what CI uses for the full `test` and `test_macos` jobs; it is not the
default local development loop.

### 3.1 Docs-only changes fast path

If all changed files are documentation-only (`*.md`, `docs/**`, `crates/*/docs/**`, root docs like `README.md` and `DEVELOPMENT.md`):

```bash
bash scripts/ci/nils-cli-checks-entrypoint.sh --docs-only
```

This also validates touched `docs/plans/**` bundles with:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/plan-bundle-validate.sh --strict
```

The docs-only entrypoint additionally runs the CLI output contract lint
(`docs/specs/cli-output-contract-v1.md`) so envelope and exit-code drift gets
caught even on PRs that only touch documentation:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/cli-output-contract-lint.sh --strict
```

The lint has a self-test under
`scripts/ci/tests/cli-output-contract-lint.test.sh` that exercises every
regression class against synthetic fixtures.

In CI, the `changes` job runs `scripts/ci/detect-docs-only.sh` (sharing the
`scripts/ci/lib/doc_classify.py` classifier with the local-fast planner). When
every changed file is documentation, the `test` and `test_macos` jobs run
`--docs-only` and the `coverage` job skips its steps, so docs-only PRs avoid the
full Rust build/test/coverage cost. The skips are step-level, so all three
release-gated checks still report success.

### 3.2 Local fast changed-scope checks

For most local implementation loops:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/nils-cli-checks-entrypoint.sh --local-fast
```

Set `NILS_CLI_TEST_RUNNER=nextest` to require `cargo-nextest`; otherwise the
local fast gate auto-selects `cargo nextest` when available and falls back to
`cargo test`.

The local fast gate is conservative. Changes to `nils-common`, `nils-term`,
`nils-test-support`, root manifests, CI scripts, completions, `.agents/`,
`.github/`, or other workspace-level paths use a workspace Rust gate because
package-scoped checks can miss reverse-dependency breakage.

### 3.3 Full checks (CI gate / optional local parity)

```bash
NILS_CLI_TEST_RUNNER=nextest bash scripts/ci/nils-cli-checks-entrypoint.sh
```

Notes:

- `nextest` mode runs `cargo nextest run --profile ci --workspace`.
- Because doctests are not included in nextest, the entrypoint also runs
  `cargo test --workspace --doc` when `NILS_CLI_TEST_RUNNER=nextest`.

### 3.4 Full coverage flow (CI gate / explicit local parity)

Coverage gate is mandatory in CI for non-doc changes and in explicit
release-quality verification (total line coverage must stay `>= 85.00%`).
Normal local development does not need to run coverage before opening a PR:

```bash
NILS_CLI_TEST_RUNNER=nextest \
  bash scripts/ci/nils-cli-checks-entrypoint.sh --with-coverage
```

`--with-coverage` runs, after the full check stack:

```bash
mkdir -p target/coverage
cargo llvm-cov nextest --profile ci --workspace --lcov --output-path target/coverage/lcov.info --fail-under-lines 85
bash scripts/ci/coverage-summary.sh target/coverage/lcov.info
cargo test --workspace --doc
```

Use the default threshold for CI parity. To run a stricter local check, override
the threshold:

```bash
NILS_CLI_COVERAGE_FAIL_UNDER_LINES=90 bash scripts/ci/nils-cli-checks-entrypoint.sh --with-coverage
```

## 4. Full checks included by the CI entrypoint

`bash scripts/ci/nils-cli-checks-entrypoint.sh` includes:

- `bash scripts/ci/docs-placement-audit.sh --strict`
- `bash scripts/ci/docs-hygiene-audit.sh --strict`
- `bash scripts/ci/markdownlint-audit.sh --strict`

- `bash scripts/ci/skill-shell-suites.sh` (runs every
  `.agents/skills/*/tests/test_*.sh` smoke suite)
- `bash scripts/ci/test-stale-audit.sh --strict`
- `bash scripts/ci/workspace-version-lockstep.sh --strict`
- `bash scripts/ci/crate-naming-audit.sh`
- `bash scripts/ci/publish-order-audit.sh --strict`

- `bash scripts/ci/completion-asset-audit.sh --strict`
- `bash scripts/ci/completion-freshness-audit.sh --strict`
- `bash scripts/ci/completion-flag-parity-audit.sh --strict`
- `zsh -f tests/zsh/completion.test.zsh`
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`

- `cargo test --workspace` (or `cargo nextest run --profile ci --workspace`
  plus `cargo test --workspace --doc` when `NILS_CLI_TEST_RUNNER=nextest`)

## 4.1 Supply-chain audit (cargo-deny)

A dedicated `cargo-deny` GitHub Actions job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on
every push and PR, independent of the Rust test jobs. Run the same gate locally
with:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/cargo-deny-audit.sh   # cargo deny check advisories bans
```

It enforces two policies from the root `deny.toml`:

- **advisories** — any RUSTSEC vulnerability / unsound advisory fails the build.
- **bans** — `multiple-versions = "deny"`: a *new* duplicate crate version fails
  the build. Duplicates that exist today only because of in-progress upstream
  ecosystem transitions are recorded in the `deny.toml` `skip` list (a ratchet).

Requires `cargo-deny` (`cargo install cargo-deny --locked` or `brew install
cargo-deny`). When a new duplicate is unavoidable, add a `skip` entry with a
`reason`; to temporarily accept an advisory, add an `ignore` entry with a
`reason`.

## 5. Additional checks when completion assets change

When completion/alias assets are changed, also run:

- `zsh -n completions/zsh/_<cli>`
- `bash -n completions/bash/<cli>`

Canonical completion policy and validation workflow:

- `docs/runbooks/cli-completion-development-standard.md`

## 6. Generated artifacts

Regenerate third-party license/notice artifacts after dependency or metadata
changes:

```bash
bash scripts/generate-third-party-artifacts.sh --write
```

Verify the generated artifacts are current before delivery:

```bash
bash scripts/generate-third-party-artifacts.sh --check
```

The artifact contract is documented in
`docs/specs/third-party-artifacts-contract-v1.md`.

### 6.1 Dependabot bumps

Every Dependabot cargo bump rewrites `Cargo.lock`, which drifts both artifacts
and fails the strict third-party audit. Two workflows handle that
automatically, split so that the privileged half never touches pull-request
content:

- `.github/workflows/dependabot-third-party-artifacts.yml` runs unprivileged on
  `pull_request` — no secrets, read-only token. It is the only place that
  executes anything from the bump, and it publishes the regenerated files as
  the `third-party-refresh` artifact.
- `.github/workflows/dependabot-third-party-apply.yml` runs privileged on
  `workflow_run`. It checks out nothing, commits the two artifact paths onto the
  Dependabot branch through the Git Data API, and squash merges
  `dependabot/cargo/cargo-minor-patch-*` once the `CI` workflow concludes
  success on that exact commit. Major-version and security bumps are refreshed
  but never auto-merged.

The artifact is untrusted input, so the applying workflow never executes it: it
writes only the two known paths, only onto the branch the run belongs to, and
only while that branch head still matches the commit the refresh was generated
for. CI then re-runs the strict audit on the resulting commit, and the merge
gate requires that run to pass.

The applying workflow requires two repository secrets, `BOT_APP_ID` and
`BOT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, for a GitHub App installed on this repository with
`Contents: read and write`, `Pull requests: read and write`, and
`Actions: read`. The App token is mandatory rather than a convenience: a commit
made with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not start a new workflow run, so the
refreshed commit would carry no CI results and could never be shown green.
Without the secrets the applying workflow fails fast with that instruction, and
`.agents/skills/project-deliver-dependabot-bump-pr` remains the manual path.

## 7. Test conventions

- In Rust tests, prefer `pretty_assertions::{assert_eq, assert_ne}` for readable diffs.

## 8. CLI version policy

- Every user-facing CLI must expose root `-V, --version`.
- For clap-based CLIs, set `#[command(version)]` on the root `Parser`.
- `--help` output should show `-V, --version`.

## 9. Local install, release, and publishing

### 9.1 Local release install helper

Build and install workspace binaries into `~/.local/nils-cli/bin` by default:

```bash
./scripts/install-local-release-binaries.sh
```

Install only one binary when you are smoke-checking a focused change:

```bash
./scripts/install-local-release-binaries.sh --bin git-scope
```

Add the install directory to `PATH` when needed:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/nils-cli/bin:$PATH"
```

### 9.2 GitHub release packaging

Release tags matching `v*` trigger `.github/workflows/release.yml`. The workflow
first verifies the tagged commit has green `test`, `test_macos`, and `coverage`
checks, then builds release tarballs for Linux and macOS on x86_64 and aarch64.

Release tarballs include:

- release-default workspace binaries from `scripts/workspace-bins.sh`
- `completions/zsh/` and `completions/bash/`
- `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`, and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`

Use the repo-owned release skill for the normal bump, tag, GitHub Release, tap,
and local Homebrew verification flow:

```bash
.agents/skills/project-bump-version-tag-release/scripts/project-bump-version-tag-release.sh --version X.Y.Z
```

`.github/workflows/prepare-private-release.yml` is a narrower preparation-only
entrypoint for the private infrastructure orchestrator. It runs the same
canonical version preparation and locked workspace check on a GitHub-hosted
runner, but uses `--skip-push` and uploads only a patch plus a checksum-bound
manifest. It has read-only repository permissions, accepts no credentials, and
does not create a branch, PR, tag, or release. The private orchestrator must
bind the artifact to the workflow run's immutable `headSha`, independently
validate the patch semantics, and own all delivery mutations.

### 9.3 crates.io publishing

Local crate publish dry-runs and direct publishes use `scripts/publish-crates.sh`.
The default crate order is `release/crates-io-publish-order.txt`.

```bash
scripts/publish-crates.sh --dry-run
scripts/publish-crates.sh --publish
scripts/publish-crates.sh --crates "nils-term nils-common" --dry-run
```

GitHub workflow dispatch is available through `.github/workflows/publish-crates.yml`.
In `publish` mode the workflow requires the repository secret
`CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`.

Use the repo-owned dispatch helper when you want workflow dispatch with run
reporting and post-run crates.io status snapshots:

```bash
.agents/skills/project-dispatch-crates-io-publish/scripts/publish-crates-io.sh --all --wait
```

To query crates.io publish status locally, use:

```bash
scripts/crates-io-status.sh --all --format text
```

Detailed status-script semantics live in
`docs/runbooks/crates-io-status-script-runbook.md`.
