# New CLI Crate Development Standard

## Purpose

This runbook defines the mandatory standard for adding a new CLI crate in this workspace.

Priority model:

1. Preserve repository CLI quality/parity expectations from `AGENTS.md`.
2. For service-consumed commands, provide a stable, service-consumable JSON contract.
3. Keep the crate publish-ready under current workspace release rules.

## Canonical Sources

Use these as the source of truth to avoid policy drift:

- Global CLI priorities and completion expectations:
  - `AGENTS.md`
- Local validation and CI coverage policy:
  - `DEVELOPMENT.md`
  - `bash scripts/ci/nils-cli-checks-entrypoint.sh --local-fast`
- Workspace completion architecture and migration rules:
  - `docs/runbooks/cli-completion-development-standard.md`
- Publishing workflow and order:
  - `scripts/publish-crates.sh`
  - `release/crates-io-publish-order.txt`
  - `.agents/skills/project-bump-version-tag-release/SKILL.md`
- `agent-docs` command semantics and registration patterns:
  - `crates/agent-docs/README.md`
- JSON contract details:
  - `docs/specs/cli-service-json-contract-guideline-v1.md`

## Applicability

Apply this standard when you add or substantially redesign any CLI crate under `crates/` that is intended for user/service consumption.

If a crate is intentionally internal-only, keep this standard for UX/testing quality, but mark the crate explicitly as non-publishable
(`publish = false`) and document the reason.

## Required Workflow

1. Create crate scaffold and workspace wiring.
2. Define command contract (flags, exit codes, text output, JSON output).
3. Implement behavior with parity/consistency to workspace conventions.
4. Add tests for both human-readable and JSON contracts.
5. Verify publish-readiness metadata and release order.
6. Run local changed-scope validation before delivery; rely on GitHub required
   checks for full workspace and coverage gates before merge.

## Crate Scaffold Rules

For a new publishable CLI crate:

- `Cargo.toml` must include:
  - `version` matching the current workspace release version (see root
    `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.package]` and the latest published value in
    `release/crates-io-publish-order.txt` / `crates/cli-template/Cargo.toml`
    as the live exemplar).
  - `edition.workspace = true`
  - `license.workspace = true`
  - `description = "CLI crate for nils-<name> in the nils-cli workspace."`
  - `repository = "https://github.com/sympoies/nils-cli"`
  - at least one `[[bin]]` target.
- Crate directory, `[package].name`, and `[[bin]].name` MUST follow
  `docs/specs/crate-cli-naming-convention-v1.md` (enforced by
  `scripts/ci/crate-naming-audit.sh`).
- Crate must be listed in workspace `members` in root `Cargo.toml`.
- Dependencies should use workspace/shared conventions when available (`[workspace.dependencies]`, local `nils-*` crates with explicit
  `version` + `path` + `package`).
- Date/time handling MUST use `jiff` (`jiff = { workspace = true }`), not
  `chrono` or `time`. `jiff` is the workspace's forward datetime standard;
  the existing `chrono` / `time` crates are grandfathered, but new crates and
  new date/time code use `jiff`.
- Add a crate README that documents commands, options, output modes, and dependencies.

For internal-only helper crates:

- Add `publish = false` and explain the reason in README.
- Do not add the crate to `release/crates-io-publish-order.txt`.

## Documentation Placement Rules

Documentation created for a new crate MUST follow `docs/specs/crate-docs-placement-policy.md`.

- Contributors MUST classify each new or updated Markdown file as `workspace-level` or `crate-local` before deciding the path.
- `crate-local` docs MUST be placed under `crates/<crate>/docs/...`.
- `crate-local` docs SHOULD use canonical paths:
  - `crates/<crate>/docs/README.md`
  - `crates/<crate>/docs/specs/<topic>.md`
  - `crates/<crate>/docs/runbooks/<topic>.md`
  - `crates/<crate>/docs/reports/<topic>.md`
- Crate-owned docs MUST NOT be added under root `docs/`.

### Workspace-Level Exceptions (Root `docs/` Allowed)

Root `docs/` is an exception path and MUST be used only when the document is `workspace-level`.

Allowed exception types:

- Repository-wide governance or process standards used across the workspace.
- Cross-crate contracts/specifications consumed by multiple crates or external services.
- Shared workspace operations runbooks (release/CI/tooling) not owned by a single crate.

Qualification criteria (both MUST pass):

- Ownership MUST be workspace-owned (not a single crate team/module).
- Scope MUST be cross-crate or repository-governance; otherwise treat the doc as `crate-local`.

## Output Contracts

Every user-facing CLI command surface must have explicit output behavior.

### Human-Readable Contract (Required)

- Default mode should be optimized for terminal use (clear sections/messages).
- `stdout` is reserved for primary command output.
- `stderr` is reserved for warnings/errors/debug/progress.
- Exit codes must be stable and documented.
- Honor `NO_COLOR=1` where colorized output exists.

### JSON Contract (Required For Service-Consumed Commands)

- JSON output must be opt-in (`--json` or `--format json`).
- JSON responses must use a versioned envelope.
- JSON mode must avoid prose-only error signaling.
- JSON payloads must never expose secret/token material.
- Full field-level requirements, examples, compatibility rules, and error envelope schema are defined in
  `docs/specs/cli-service-json-contract-guideline-v1.md`.

### JSON Compatibility Rules

- Additive fields are allowed within the same schema version.
- Renaming/removing required fields is breaking and requires a new schema version.
- Keep old schema behavior available until consumers migrate.
- Contract tests are mandatory for required keys/types and representative failure paths.

## Command and UX Rules

- Use clap-based parsing with stable help text.
- Root CLI parser must include `#[command(version)]` so `-V, --version` is always available.
- Usage errors return `64` unless a documented command contract specifies otherwise.
- Keep warning/error prefix conventions consistent with neighboring crates.
- For completion-required CLIs, implement clap-first completion generation via `clap_complete` so baseline completion covers subcommands,
  long/short flags, declared value candidates, and context-aware filtering (not global candidate dumps).
- If completions or completion aliases are provided, implement them per `docs/runbooks/cli-completion-development-standard.md` (clap-first
  generation, thin shell adapters, alias sync, and single completion path policy).

## Testing and Validation Rules

Minimum testing for new CLI crates:

1. Unit tests for core parsing/formatting/edge-case logic.
2. Integration tests for CLI behavior and exit codes.
3. JSON contract tests:
   - required top-level fields.
   - stable error envelope fields.
   - no secret leakage.
4. Completion tests if completions/aliases were changed.
5. Completion architecture conformance to `docs/runbooks/cli-completion-development-standard.md` when completion assets are introduced or
   modified.

Preferred local validation entrypoint:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/nils-cli-checks-entrypoint.sh --local-fast
```

Pre-commit docs placement audit (required):

```bash
bash scripts/ci/docs-placement-audit.sh --strict
```

For exact command sets, optional full local parity, and the CI coverage
threshold, follow `docs/runbooks/workspace-maintenance-reference.md`.

## Publish Readiness Checklist

Before claiming a new publishable CLI crate is ready:

1. Cargo metadata matches workspace conventions.
2. README exists and includes command/output documentation.
3. Crate appears in root workspace `members`.
4. Publish order file includes the crate at a dependency-safe position:
   - `release/crates-io-publish-order.txt`
5. Publish dry-run succeeds:

```bash
scripts/publish-crates.sh --dry-run --crate <crate-package-name>
```

If crate is non-publishable (`publish = false`), verify it is excluded from publish order.

## Agent-Docs Integration

This document is an on-demand `project-dev` reference for new or substantially
redesigned CLI crates.

Declare it as an optional `[[document]]` entry in the project
`AGENT_DOCS.toml` catalog (see `crates/agent-docs/README.md`). `AGENTS.md`
routes applicable work here without forcing the full standard into unrelated
edits:

```toml
[[document]]
context  = "project-dev"
scope    = "project"
path     = "docs/runbooks/new-cli-crate-development-standard.md"
required = false
notes    = "New CLI crate standard (human output + JSON contract + publish-ready)"
```

Then verify strict resolution:

```bash
agent-docs preflight --intent project-dev --strict
```

## Review Checklist (PR Gate)

- [ ] Human-readable output behavior is documented and tested.
