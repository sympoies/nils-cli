# CLI Completion Development Standard

## Purpose

This runbook defines the workspace standard for CLI completion architecture, implementation boundaries, migration safety, and validation
gates.

## Canonical Sources

- Global completion obligations and alias families:
  - `AGENTS.md`
- Local validation and CI coverage policy:
  - `DEVELOPMENT.md`
  - `bash scripts/ci/nils-cli-checks-entrypoint.sh --local-fast`
- Workspace completion assets and tests:
  - `completions/zsh/`
  - `completions/bash/`
  - `tests/zsh/completion.test.zsh`
- Per-CLI migration contract template:
  - `docs/specs/completion-contract-template.md`
- New crate implementation standard:
  - `docs/runbooks/new-cli-crate-development-standard.md`

## Completion Quality Contract

For every completion-required CLI, baseline completion quality must include:

1. subcommands and nested subcommands
2. long and short flags
3. declared value candidates where available (for example enum-like values)
4. context-aware filtering by cursor position (avoid global "show everything" candidate dumps)

This matches modern Rust CLI expectations (e.g., ripgrep/bat/fd style behavior):

- zsh usually shows richer descriptions
- bash usually shows more compact candidates

## Canonical Completion Architecture (Clap-First)

Every completion-required CLI must follow this layered architecture:

1. clap command model as source of truth (`Parser`/`Subcommand`/`Args`)
2. `clap_complete` generated completion baseline for zsh/bash
3. thin repo adapters only for alias wiring and optional dynamic extensions

### Clap command model contract

The CLI crate must keep completion-relevant metadata in clap definitions:

- command tree and flags from clap types
- value candidates via `ValueEnum` / `PossibleValue` / parser constraints
- path/command hints via `ValueHint` when applicable

Do not keep command/flag truth in shell scripts.

### Generation and export contract

Each completion-required CLI must expose a user-facing export path for completions, for example:

- `<cli> completion <shell>`
- `<cli> --generate-completion <shell>`

Implementation should be powered by `clap_complete` generation APIs.

Repository distribution contract:

- generated zsh assets live in `completions/zsh/_<cli>`
- generated bash assets live in `completions/bash/<cli>`
- generated outputs must be deterministic and committed alongside CLI surface changes
- full CI generates fresh bash/zsh output for comparison and fails when it
  differs from committed generated snapshots; runtime loader adapters are
  covered by adapter tests

### Thin adapter and dynamic extension contract

Shell adapters may only:

- register completion for canonical command names and required aliases
- apply minor shell-specific formatting/wiring
- apply deterministic fail-closed behavior when generated completion cannot be loaded

Dynamic/runtime value completion is optional and must extend (not replace) clap-generated baseline:

- preferred dynamic path: `clap_complete::env::CompleteEnv`
- alternative dynamic path (when needed): crate-local hidden completion command (e.g., `__complete`)

### Shared adapter helper contract

Workspace adapters may share common helper scripts for zsh/bash to reduce duplicated loader and registration logic while preserving thin
adapter behavior.

Canonical helper files:

- `completions/zsh/_completion-adapter-common.zsh`
- `completions/bash/completion-adapter-common.bash`

Helper contract:

- generated loading helper: fetches `<cli> completion <shell>`, renames generated function symbols per adapter, strips known
  self-registration blocks when needed, caches success/failure state, and validates that the generated function is callable
- registration helper: registers one completion entrypoint for canonical command and alias names (`compdef`/`complete`) without mutating
  alias definitions
- fail-closed helper: enforces empty/no-candidates behavior on generated-load failure and does not route to alternate completion stacks

Adapter integration requirements:

- adapters stay responsible for CLI-specific alias rewrite semantics (for example `cxgp -> agent prompt`)
- adapters may source shared helpers from their own completion directory; on helper lookup failure, adapters must still fail closed and must
  not add alternate fallback code paths
- helper usage must keep completion behavior contract-compatible with existing adapter expectations

### Shell compatibility caveats

- zsh helper loading should prefer the adapter source path (`functions_source[...]`) and then `fpath` lookup to support both direct `source`
  and autoloaded completion contexts
- bash helper loading should resolve helper paths from `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` so colocated helper files are found when completion scripts are
  sourced from arbitrary working directories
- when generated scripts include shell/version-guard wrappers that conflict with renamed generated function names, helpers may strip those
  wrappers before `eval`, but only in deterministic, documented ways
- `zsh -n` and `bash -n` checks verify syntax only; runtime behavior still requires completion tests (`tests/zsh/completion.test.zsh`) to
  protect alias wiring and single-path invariants

## Contract Boundaries: Rust vs Shell

Rust responsibilities:

- command/subcommand/flag/value completion truth
- completion export behavior and generated content
- dynamic value providers (if used)
- completion contract tests

Shell responsibilities:

- completion hook registration (`compdef` / `complete`)
- alias registration and alias-to-command mapping
- generated-script loading and thin adapter wiring only

Any logic that can drift from clap parsing belongs in Rust, not shell adapters.

## Alias Sync Policy (zsh/bash)

When a CLI ships aliases, alias definitions are a dual-shell contract:

- Zsh aliases: `completions/zsh/aliases.zsh`
- Bash aliases: `completions/bash/aliases.bash`

Rules:

- add/remove/rename aliases in both files in the same change
- keep alias families aligned with workspace policy:
  - `gs*` for `git-scope`
  - `gx*` for `git-cli`
  - `cx*` for `codex-cli` (no `codex-*`/`crl*`)
  - `fx*` for `fzf-cli`
- ensure completion registration covers aliases that require command completion behavior

## Single Completion Path Policy

Completion implementations must use a single clap-generated completion stack.

Rules:

- do not add runtime completion-mode toggles for completion behavior
- do not keep alternate completion dispatch functions alongside clap-generated completion paths
- if generated completion quality is wrong, fix clap metadata and/or thin adapter logic in-place
- generated-load failure must fail closed (empty/no candidates) rather than routing to an alternate path

### Completion engine: static vs dynamic

The single-path rule governs *how many* completion stacks a CLI has (exactly
one), not *which* `clap_complete` engine backs it. A CLI declares its engine via
the optional `completion_engine=<static|dynamic>` key in its matrix
enforcement-metadata tuple (absent means `static`):

- `static` (default): the CLI ships a `clap_complete::generate()`-baked baseline
  committed under `completions/`. Every current CLI is `static`.
- `dynamic`: the CLI opts into `clap_complete::env::CompleteEnv` (behind
  `clap_complete`'s `unstable-dynamic` feature) so it can compute candidates at
  TAB time (worktree names, branches, remotes, tags, live paths) that a static
  model cannot enumerate. It is opt-in per CLI and never forced.

`dynamic` mode is a single completion path, not an alternate dispatch: the CLI's
`completion <shell>` export emits exactly one registration (the `CompleteEnv`
stub), the binary is the sole candidate source, and idle invocation (with
`COMPLETE` unset) runs the normal app path at zero cost. It therefore satisfies
`completion_mode_toggles=forbidden` and `alternate_completion_dispatch=forbidden`
— there is no runtime toggle and no second dispatch function — and it extends,
rather than replaces, the clap-first contract. Generated-load failure still
fails closed.

Framework handling of a `dynamic` CLI:

- The completion-freshness audit classifies it as a runtime adapter and skips
  the static byte-diff (the `CompleteEnv` stub embeds the resolved binary path
  and has no reproducible static baseline); the committed registration asset
  must still exist.
- Flag-parity skips a `dynamic` CLI's static flag diff: the committed asset is a
  `CompleteEnv` registration stub with no static flag list to compare against
  `--help` (skips are counted, never silent).
- The shared runtime adapter loads the dynamic registration shape
  (`_clap_dynamic_completer_<bin>` for zsh / `_clap_complete_<bin>` +
  `complete -F` for bash) through
  `_nils_cli_completion_common_load_dynamic_{zsh,bash}`, which renames the
  completer, strips the raw `compdef`/`complete` registration line, and lets the
  thin adapter keep alias-family rewrite through the underlying binary.
- `git-cli` is the first `dynamic` CLI: `worktree go`/`remove` complete live
  worktree names and branches (superseding the static `gxwcd` workaround). Until
  a CLI declares `completion_engine=dynamic`, every audit and adapter path is
  unchanged.

### Required completion enforcement metadata

Every completion-required CLI migration must declare and validate this metadata contract in both:

- the CLI row in `docs/specs/completion-coverage-matrix-v1.md`
- the crate-local migration contract copied from `docs/specs/completion-contract-template.md`

Canonical metadata tuple:

- `completion_mode=clap-first`
- `completion_mode_toggles=forbidden` (runtime completion-mode toggles are disallowed)
- `alternate_completion_dispatch=forbidden`
- `generated_load_failure=fail-closed`
- `completion_engine=static|dynamic` (optional; absent means `static` — see "Completion engine: static vs dynamic")

Validation expectation:

- migration contracts must include explicit evidence for completion metadata checks
- validation must include completion-mode toggle and alternate-dispatch grep checks for touched completion paths

## Testing Requirements and Validation Linkage

Completion work must satisfy completion-specific checks, local changed-scope
validation, and GitHub required checks before merge.

Mandatory completion-focused validation when completion code changes:

1. `zsh -f tests/zsh/completion.test.zsh`
2. `zsh -n completions/zsh/_<cli>`
3. `bash -n completions/bash/<cli>`
4. export smoke check from CLI (example pattern):
   - `<cli> completion zsh | rg -- "--help|--version|--"`

Mandatory local repository validation:

- preferred single entrypoint:
  - `bash scripts/ci/nils-cli-checks-entrypoint.sh --local-fast`
- docs-only fast path (when all changed files are docs):
  - `bash scripts/ci/nils-cli-checks-entrypoint.sh --docs-only`
- full CI freshness check:
  - `bash scripts/ci/completion-freshness-audit.sh --strict`
- for non-doc changes, GitHub required checks enforce full workspace tests and
  coverage `>= 85.00%` per
  `docs/runbooks/workspace-maintenance-reference.md`

Completion changes are not merge-ready until local validation and GitHub
required checks are green.

## Rollout Checklist: Migrating an Existing CLI

Use this checklist for every existing CLI migration. The migration is only complete when the per-CLI contract is filled, validation evidence
is captured, and acceptance criteria are checked.

1. confirm the CLI is completion-required (or explicitly excluded) in `docs/specs/completion-coverage-matrix-v1.md`, and for `required` CLIs
   ensure the matrix row has explicit completion enforcement metadata
2. create the per-CLI migration contract from `docs/specs/completion-contract-template.md`:
   - `mkdir -p crates/<crate>/docs/reports`
   - `cp docs/specs/completion-contract-template.md crates/<crate>/docs/reports/<cli>-completion-migration-contract.md`
3. fill the contract `command graph`, `value providers`, `alias map`, `completion enforcement metadata`, and `single-path invariants`
   sections before changing code so scope and invariants are explicit
4. ensure clap model fully expresses subcommands/flags/value candidates
5. add completion export path (e.g., `completion <shell>`) powered by `clap_complete`
6. generate/update `completions/zsh/_<cli>` and `completions/bash/<cli>`
7. keep shell adapters thin (alias wiring and optional dynamic hooks only)
8. if dynamic values are needed, add `CompleteEnv` (or crate-local `__complete` only where justified)
9. enforce single-path completion policy and metadata values (no runtime completion-mode gates or alternate completion functions)
10. sync aliases in both alias files when alias-bearing CLIs are touched and update the contract `alias map` with any rewrite semantics
11. run contract validation commands and local repository validation; record output in the contract, including completion metadata and CI status
    verification evidence
12. mark contract acceptance criteria complete and link the contract path in PR notes
