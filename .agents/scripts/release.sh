# nils-cli's /release — thin wrapper over the canonical skill script.
#
# Kept here so the global dispatcher (~/.claude/scripts/release.sh) finds
# this repo's release flow under the dispatcher convention
# (<repo>/.agents/scripts/release.sh). The real logic still lives in
# .agents/skills/project-bump-version-tag-release/ so codex / opencode
# discover it through their skill-indexing mechanism — per the multi-CLI
# mirror rule in claude-kit's docs/dispatcher-commands.md.
#
# All args forward unchanged to the skill script; behaviour is identical
# whether you reach it via /release or via the skill directly. The script only
# prepares the version-bump commit: it never tags, pushes, or publishes. The
# sympoies-infra release broker owns those steps.
