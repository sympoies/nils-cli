//! Typed runtime-fault classification and the three bounded interaction lanes.
//!
//! A capability that cannot prove itself must not admit arbitrary mutation. That
//! posture is correct and is preserved here. What it must not do is take the
//! whole session with it: in `sympoies/nils-cli#1409` a coordination failure
//! blocked plain `UserPromptSubmit` text, so the user could not ask what was
//! wrong or request the repair, and `Stop` re-entered the same failing gate until
//! the provider force-terminated the turn.
//!
//! The fix is lane separation rather than a weaker gate:
//!
//! * [`Lane::Conversation`] — prompts, session start, and clarification. A
//!   runtime fault degrades this lane to read-only with one primary diagnosis and
//!   one safe next action. No new authority is acquired.
//! * [`Lane::Mutation`] — tool admission. Unchanged: a fault that cannot be
//!   proven still fails closed.
//! * [`Lane::Terminal`] — the Stop family. A fault, or provider re-entry
//!   metadata, produces one deterministic terminal result. Recovery is named
//!   only when the observed coordination outcome requires it; unrelated Stop
//!   blocks do not manufacture claim, operation, or gating assertions.
