# agent-session

## Overview

`agent-session` starts and manages tmux-backed Codex, Claude Code, and Hermes sessions for mobile handoff workflows. It is designed for
personal automation such as Hermes Telegram skills and the agent-console mobile control plane: a service can create the session with a full
prompt, then return a short tmux attach command for the user to continue from Termius, glance at the pane, or steer it with keystrokes.

```

`main-agent` is the typed, authenticated facade for durable Main Agent runs and
managed-worker relationships. Private objective and assignment packets are
read only through the current session capability; ordinary `agent-session`
list/serve/activity projections expose bounded relationship metadata only.
Compatibility-sensitive callers must require
`main-agent.capabilities.v1` to advertise
`main-agent.runtime-checkpoint-file.v1` and
`runtime-kit.checkpoint-write-admission.v1`, with `compatible:true`. The second
capability is derived for the requested Codex or Claude provider from the
installed sibling `agent-hook` inventory's
bundle version `2026.07.28.1` or newer and its locked
`agent-session.coordination.v1` rules, so the probe rejects a mixed
CLI/runtime-hook deployment. It additionally requires that provider's
converged doctor record and executes its installed handler's versioned
capability self-probe, so a new policy with stale or missing handler code also
fails closed without requiring the other provider to be installed. The
bundle-version boundary identifies the first policy whose paired handler admits
the checkpoint write; the package version alone does not prove this API.
Before `init` or any managed mutation, `main-agent self readiness` verifies the
current incarnation's exact `AGENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT_FILE` binding and trusted
mode-0600 file. A pre-deployment incarnation fails closed with
`runtime-checkpoint-unavailable` and must be resumed or restarted.
Authenticated worker `bootstrap --format json` returns a private
`checkpoint_file` bound to the current runtime incarnation. Write later
checkpoint objects to that pre-created mode-0600 file and pass the same path to
`main-agent checkpoint --file`; do not allocate a separate worker checkpoint
path under a repository or project output tree.
Follow the [Main Agent orchestration runbook](docs/runbooks/main-agent-orchestration.md)
for packet examples, revision and retry rules, interactive worker acceptance,
resume/rebind, relationship transfers, and terminal cleanup.
The top-level relationship and lifecycle commands are `collaborate`, `borrow`,
`handoff`, `adopt`, `close`, and `closeout`; `packet-schema` prints a valid
objective-packet example for `init`. Use `completion <bash|zsh>` on either
binary to generate its shell completion script.

In particular, fresh worker launch first validates that `launch.cwd` is an existing canonical
directory. Fresh Codex launch also requires explicit trust for that exact
directory in the active Codex configuration; missing or unverifiable trust
fails with typed guidance before assignment persistence or provider launch.
The canonical verified Codex configuration directory is bound into the pending
receipt, session record, and provider environment, so a long-lived service
cannot preflight one configuration and launch against another. A durable
controller-claim operation fence blocks claim release from the final authority
check through child attachment. The runtime never accepts provider trust
automatically. In addition,
bare single-assignment `worker start` defaults to waiting up to 5 minutes for
the typed readiness proof; select explicit `--await-ready 0` for launch-only
behavior. Batch launch remains transport-only so its bounded lane count cannot
multiply readiness deadlines. Its parent
idempotency receipt binds the sorted lane names and raw packet digests before
any lane starts; exact replay resumes incomplete lanes, including transient or
ambiguous child failures reconciled through the lane receipt, while membership,
rename, order, or byte drift conflicts before launch. A nonzero wait
persists one fixed readiness deadline and leased finalizer, so concurrent exact
replays join the same attempt and return the same final receipt. The receipt
also persists the automatic recovery reservation and its reserved/sending/sent
substage in the same locked commit that reserves the attempt, so a stale
finalizer cannot reserve recovery after a successor takes over. Finalizer
takeover continues the same attempt and never repeats an Enter with an
ambiguous outcome. The short takeover lease is extended beyond
the pane-input timeout only while `sending` is in flight. A fresh
Codex or Claude worker that remains `starting` receives at most one
runtime-owned recovery Enter; automatic and explicit recovery share one durable
attempt reservation, and prompt load, paste, and Enter each occur at most once
for a completed start stage. An exact retry can replace only a matching record
that durably proves tmux was never launched. The serialized send
boundary rechecks exact worker, activity, broker, claim, and operation evidence
immediately before input, then revalidates the reserving Main Agent
session/incarnation and its run/assignment ownership while preserving the
coordination-to-orchestration lock order. Broker evidence must be
incarnation-matched, ready, fresh, and backed by the matching private
capability. Explicit recovery stores
a provisional replay receipt. Every manager-owned assignment mutation is
fenced until the bounded attempt resolves or a newer worker checkpoint proves
that input was consumed. An interrupted automatic reservation can be adopted
for observation, but adoption never sends input or revokes a potentially live
sender. An unknown send outcome remains mutation-fenced while that incarnation
may still act. `worker reconcile-recovery` is the explicit non-resend terminal
escape: it succeeds only while holding the exact worker record and
coordination-quiescence guards after proving the runtime/tmux command stopped,
the worker claim absent, operations quiescent, and Main Agent authority still
active. Stopped proof combines every persisted cgroup, process-session, and
process-group source: live evidence dominates, unavailable evidence fails
closed, and `Stopped` requires every available source to prove absence. Before
recording `reconciled`, the command atomically persists a session-owned
exact-incarnation quarantine marker that rejects session resume, maintenance
resume, work-context claim, bootstrap, checkpoint, and equivalent
execution-authority restoration without coupling unrelated sessions to the
orchestration registry. A retry after marker persistence adopts the matching
durable marker before completing the registry transition. Guarded cancellation of that
absorbing terminal record reacquires the
same stopped-runtime and quiescence boundaries and therefore remains available
after the exact worker broker has stopped and cleared its capability. Otherwise
it fails closed. Cancellation also revalidates the exact Main Agent claim while
holding coordination quiescence through the orchestration commit. A newer
authenticated worker checkpoint can also resolve the attempt. Its provisional receipt stays
resumable: an exact-key retry observes the same attempt without resending and
may upgrade the receipt once that checkpoint or a definitive failure resolves
the outcome.
`main-agent quick` includes the canonical readiness wait in its parent
idempotency contract while continuing to recognize historical parent and
`{parent}-worker` child receipts during rolling upgrades.
Readiness still requires the interactive worker to
be visible, attachable, authenticated, and checkpointed after that reservation.
An authoritative completed or failed provider turn ends the wait early when no
checkpoint exists. Use `worker supervise` as the repeatable macro-first health
check; it combines assignment, activity, claim, operation, and clean-worktree
evidence into a typed classification and deterministic next action. Missing,
corrupt, or identity-mismatched evidence fails closed as `worker_unreachable`
or `evidence_unavailable`. `worker reassign` performs only a proven-safe
pre-claim cancellation, guarded retirement, and distinct clean replacement
launch. Its exact retry resumes after the last completed stage without
repeating it. If a macro stops, continue from `last_proven_safe_state` with
`worker diagnose`, `submit-recovery`, `cancel`, or `retire`; never resend the
prompt, inject a second Enter, or accept a trust, update, authentication,
permission, or MCP dialog automatically.

Supervision persists a privacy-safe, bounded material worktree fingerprint:
porcelain status, staged and unstaged binary diffs, and bounded untracked
path/content evidence. Continued edits to an already-modified file and
deletion-only changes therefore reset progress age; unavailable, oversized, or
non-regular material fails closed. Broker-heartbeat staleness is classified
separately from work-context expiry. `coordination_broker_stale` routes recovery
to the target session's exact authenticated broker owner;
`edit_authority_stale` requests a bounded recheck; only
`claim_renewal_required` asks the worker to renew its own claim.

When the final durable `worker-start` receipt proves bounded readiness ended
with `worker-checkpoint-timeout`, the exact worker is still live, no worker
claim or operation exists, and no recovery send is `attempting`,
supervision returns `readiness_stop_required` in the additive v3 diagnose,
supervise, and recovery-action envelopes. Its executable Main-owned action is
revision- and exact-incarnation-fenced `worker stop-runtime`. The command
first persists a session-owned exact-worker fence, then commits the
per-assignment stopping reservation and seals only that worker's coordination
authority. Both global registries are released before stopping the verified
runtime process boundary. It sends no provider input and preserves the
assignment, session record, and worktree. The session-owned fence denies
CLI/HTTP/maintenance resume, broker, claim, bootstrap, and checkpoint authority
until guarded retirement deletes the stopped session. Its `in_progress` state
also blocks every non-owner assignment mutation during marker-first recovery;
verified termination advances it to `stopped` before the assignment
reservation is cleared. If the recorded Main controller becomes unavailable
after reservation, authenticated orphan `adopt` transfers only the exact
fence, reservation, and progress replay authority to an active successor Main.
Successive orphan transfers may advance only the ownership revision; the
original stop revision and every other stop identity remain immutable.
An account-handoff reservation must be completed or cancelled before the stop is advertised.
After an interrupted admitted stop, supervision reports
`readiness_stop_in_progress` until exact replay converges. A following
supervision read must classify the stopped lane as `pre_claim_failure`;
ordinary guarded cancel/retire or a distinct reassign then owns
terminalization. A failed submit-recovery record alone never authorizes the
stop, and an unknown `attempting` send remains on the stopped-runtime `worker
reconcile-recovery` path.

For a `working` worker that is authoritatively idle while its exact
assignment-derived claim remains active, `worker stop-claimed-runtime` is the
separate post-claim stop-only action. It requires the exact assignment
revision, worker incarnation, running runtime identity, worker claim,
authoritative activity boundary, broker/work context, and zero active or
uncertain operations. It persists a session-owned fence before stopping the
runtime, so the launch wrapper's clean broker shutdown cannot release the
claim. A narrow mutation fence holds the exact controller and worker claim
tuples stable while leaving unrelated coordination available across the
bounded runtime stop and its post-stop proof. It sends no provider input and preserves the `working` assignment,
session, worktree, and claim for `worker reconcile-stopped`. Interrupted
execution is projected as `claimed_runtime_stop_in_progress` in the additive
v5 diagnose/supervise/recovery-action envelopes and must be resumed only with
the returned exact argv. If the owning Main dies after the stop completes,
orphan `adopt` rebinds both persistent stop identities to the successor while
retaining the original controller and revision lineage, so successor
`reconcile-stopped` and exact terminal worker deletion remain available.

`main-agent self recover` is the ownership-qualified controller recovery macro.
It proves the current caller is the exact Main Agent incarnation with an
unchanged live runtime, active claim, matching broker identity, and no active or
uncertain operation, then adopts the existing broker recovery primitive. A
healthy broker is an idempotent no-op. There is no ambiguous top-level
`recover`, and the command never changes accounts, resumes or replaces the
provider, resends a prompt, sends Enter, or clears an operation fence.

Resume bootstrap retains `previous_worker`, moves only unread/unexpired guidance
from the exact current controller to the new worker incarnation, and preserves
the message ID and unread state with bounded forwarding provenance.
`worker guidance-reconcile` is the revision-fenced idempotent repair action when
supervision still reports stale-incarnation guidance; it never exposes a body
or marks worker consumption.

For an app-server-managed Codex worker with typed account and auto-resume
controls, `worker account-handoff` is the revision-fenced, explicitly authorized
macro that queues the allowlisted account, waits for the exact incumbent
incarnation to apply it, verifies the binding, and re-arms structured
continuation. It never uses `/logout` or raw terminal input. A raw worker has no
public restart flag: unsupported handoff fails closed and reports the stable
`agent-session.codex-managed-account-handoff.v1` capability required from a
daemon-launched managed worker, without changing the account or runtime. A
bounded raw rate-limit diagnostic is attempted only after both provider and
material progress are truly stale, and only for an exact durable
selected-account provenance; ambient authentication is never treated as
account identity.

Handoff moves the assignment run and primary manager atomically under the
source coordination guard. It refuses upstream or reverse dependency edges
that would become cross-run. `worker message` revalidates the exact run,
primary manager, worker, and active sender claim while holding the same
coordination-to-orchestration lock order through mailbox persistence. Handoff
also revalidates that claim from its retained coordination guard, so released
or stale source authority cannot mutate after the initial check.

`send` pushes input to a live session: literal text (`--text` / `--text-stdin`) and/or repeatable named keys
(`--key enter|escape|backspace|c-c|up|down|left|right|tab`), so codex/claude approval prompts and terminal editing
remain usable from a phone.
`glance` returns the recent pane tail plus live status as a JSON contract for dashboard tiles (cheaper than a full attach).
`resume` recreates a missing tmux runtime only when the session has exact provider resume metadata; it never resumes the
latest provider conversation implicitly. Runtime metadata is persisted before launch so hooks see the new generation,
and the immutable tmux session/pane identity is persisted before a successful start or resume returns. Resume first
proves the current and every retained prior launch identity stopped, so a surviving provider process cannot be hidden by
a new runtime generation. A worker carrying a stopped-recovery quarantine
cannot resume into a new runtime generation.
An older stopped record without that proof returns the same non-retryable manual-verification action as deletion; only
a generation durably marked as never launched can resume without a runtime identity. If tmux launch fails, the prior
runtime and activity snapshot are restored only after any possibly launched replacement is verified stopped. An
unverified replacement remains the current discoverable generation. `send` bumps `updated_at`, so `list` orders by real
control-plane activity.
`delete` removes provider runtime files and session metadata only after bounded checks verify the recorded runtime is
stopped. Before killing a live runtime, it inspects only the managed `0.0` pane, captures its immutable tmux session/pane
ids and process boundary, validates the runtime's `AGENT_SESSION_*` ownership markers, persists that identity for retry, and
uses one tmux-server conditional command to kill only if the captured session, pane, and pane PID still match.
If the managed pane is replaced, it durably retains every unresolved observed process identity before proceeding. It then
targets only the captured tmux session id. On Linux it snapshots each verified process-session member by PID and start time
and requires the pane to be in a leaf cgroup-v2 `tmux-spawn-*.scope`. It pins the process sets observed before and during a
bounded stabilization window after freezing that cgroup, revalidates the pane membership and cgroup inode, conditionally
kills the exact tmux identity, and
invokes `cgroup.kill` while the boundary remains frozen. Members present at either verified boundary cannot survive by
changing process session or by later cgroup migration. The cgroup identity also records the Linux boot id, so startup
recovery never applies an old PID/start-time or cgroup identity to a different boot. A durable ownership marker lets a
delete retry or a restarted server thaw only a scope that deletion changed from unfrozen to frozen; a scope that was already
frozen remains frozen. Without that distinct leaf cgroup, Linux deletion fails closed
before mutating tmux; other Unix platforms retain verify-only handling for the pane process-group boundary. Cleanup requires
tmux and every retained process boundary to be gone. A retry can
finish cleanup without another kill only when all persisted identities verify stopped. Live records created by an older
version can be upgraded from their ownership markers. A stopped pre-upgrade record without a provable launch identity remains
retained and returns `runtime-identity-unavailable`, `retryable: false`, and
`action: manual-runtime-verification-required`; an operator must verify its runtime manually before removing that state.
Kill failures, ambiguous tmux errors, ownership mismatches, and surviving processes retain all session state. Human
success output reports the verified stopped state; the v1 JSON `killed: true` field remains stable for successful deletion.
When tmux returns a successful but blank identity probe for a stale session, deletion confirms the exact session is absent
and still requires every persisted process boundary to verify stopped before removing metadata.
For a stopped session without a one-shot run log, `agent-session logs <id>` falls back to the private, tail-capped startup
diagnostic. Codex sessions retain that diagnostic after a startup failure or non-zero provider-client exit; a clean exit
after readiness discards it.
`--agent hermes` launches `hermes chat` interactively (one-shot `run` mode is codex/claude only).

## Work coordination

Work coordination is advisory by default. Managed sessions publish
privacy-safe presence and can declare repository-relative exact paths or
prefixes; overlapping work warns without blocking unless the session starts
with `--coordination-mode enforce`. Session IDs and claim IDs are selectors,
not credentials. Owner operations use the private per-incarnation capability.

Coordination does not grant or revoke user authorization, repository
permission, provider consent, or workflow authority. In default `advisory`
mode, missing context, unavailable coordination, and overlap reports remain
non-blocking. `work-context set` adds optional public task metadata so warnings
are more precise; it is not a permission request. Only a launch that explicitly
selects `--coordination-mode enforce` turns claims, admission, and physical
checkout leases into mutation requirements.

Use [Work coordination](docs/runbooks/work-coordination.md) for the operator
workflow and path syntax. The normative schemas, state machines, authorization
rules, limits, error codes, and HTTP coverage live in
[Session coordination v1](docs/specs/session-coordination-v1.md).

The canonical agent-facing policy, including how an agent responds to overlap
advice, lives in agent-runtime-kit's
[`session-coordination.md`](https://github.com/sympoies/agent-runtime-kit/blob/main/core/policies/session-coordination.md).
This README defines CLI and operator semantics only.

## Turn-state integration

Supported provider hooks project metadata-only lifecycle events into a private,
runtime-bound activity snapshot. Provider registration is owned by
`agent-hook`; the retained `agent-session activity setup` command is a
compatibility forwarder:

```bash
agent-session activity setup --agent codex --dry-run
agent-session activity setup --agent codex --repair --expected-preview-digest sha256:<reviewed-plan-digest>
agent-session activity setup --agent codex --remove
agent-session activity doctor --agent codex --format json
```

The forwarder maps compatibility flags and validates the typed `agent-hook`
response. If the matching `agent-hook` binary is absent, setup returns
`agent-hook-setup-unavailable` without writing provider configuration. Existing
`activity hook`, `activity notify`, and read-only `activity doctor` paths remain
for runtime compatibility and migration diagnostics.

`activity doctor` remains read-only. Codex launch readiness requires a bounded,
strictly typed `agent-hook doctor` result for Codex whose status is
`converged`, whose owned count is exact, and whose retired residue is zero.
Missing, failed, malformed, oversized, multi-record, or mismatched
control-plane evidence fails closed. The diagnostic still recognizes exact pre-dispatch
`agent-session` registrations, including an audited Computer Use outer wrapper
at the fixed executable path under the active Codex config root, so an operator
can diagnose and migrate older installations. Existing `activity hook` and
`activity notify` ingestion paths
also remain as fail-open runtime compatibility while `agent-hook` becomes the
single provider-registration owner.

Turn state also gates input. While a session is `needs_input` its pane belongs
to a provider approval or question dialog, not to a prompt box, so `send`
refuses input carrying literal text with `agent-blocked` before anything reaches
the terminal, and `prompt` refuses outright. Special keys stay admitted — that
is how the dialog gets answered — and `send --allow-blocked` is the deliberate
opt-in for typing into the dialog's own field. See the
[serve API contract](docs/specs/serve-api-v1.md) for the exact codes and
details.

Use the [turn-state contract](docs/turn-state-contract.md) for persistence,
privacy, registration ownership, setup, repair, migration, and provider
behavior. The evidence behind supported provider signals is recorded in
[provider turn-signal evidence](docs/provider-turn-signal-evidence.md).

## Serve daemon

`agent-session serve` exposes the local session control plane over HTTP and
WebSocket for an authenticated per-machine edge. Bind it to loopback, provide
the bearer token through stdin, and expose the edge rather than the raw port:

```bash
read -r -s AGENT_SESSION_SERVE_TOKEN
printf '%s' "$AGENT_SESSION_SERVE_TOKEN" | \
  agent-session serve --bind 127.0.0.1:8781 --token-stdin
unset AGENT_SESSION_SERVE_TOKEN
```

Keep that temporary shell variable unexported. The accepted
`AGENT_SESSION_TOKEN` compatibility input can be inherited by managed child
sessions, so it is not a safe credential source for a daemon that creates them.

Use [Serve daemon operations](docs/runbooks/serve-daemon.md) for deployment,
authentication boundaries, session creation, and restart survival. Integrators
should use the normative [Serve API v1](docs/specs/serve-api-v1.md), plus the
[activity stream](docs/specs/activity-stream-v1.md) and
[coordination](docs/specs/session-coordination-v1.md) contracts.

## Output contract

Human-readable text is the default. JSON is opt-in with `--format json` on command subcommands.

JSON output uses the workspace envelope: `schema_version`, `ok`, `data`, optional `warnings`, and `error` on failure.

## Secret-safety boundary

Prompts are stored under the local agent-session state directory and are not printed in command output. For sensitive prompts, prefer
interactive `start`; one-shot `run` may need to pass the prompt through the underlying agent process command line depending on that agent's
CLI capabilities. `send` routes literal text through a private (0600) buffer file loaded into tmux, so it never appears in the tmux
command line or command output; the JSON contract reports only `sent_text` (a boolean) and the special-key names, never the text itself.
Values passed with `--agent-arg` are persisted in the private session record so durable resume can recreate the same provider invocation.
Do not put secrets in provider arguments. For Claude sessions, provider identity/resume flags such as `--session-id`, `--resume`/`-r`,
`--continue`/`-c`, `--fork-session`, and `--from-pr` are reserved for agent-session so the stored resume identity stays exact.
For secrets, prefer `--text-stdin`: `--text <value>` still places the literal in agent-session's own process arguments (visible in `ps`
to same-user processes), exactly as the existing `--prompt` flag does. `send` is not idempotent — keystrokes are delivered before the
command returns, so a retry after a mid-delivery failure can re-send; callers that auto-retry should account for this.
