# Main Agent DSH external-runtime provider (v1)

This spec defines how the `main-agent` orchestration facade supports
`launch.agent = "dsh"` workers whose runtime is owned by an external harness
(the DeepSeek Harness `dsh-runtime-kit` bundle) instead of a tmux-managed
provider CLI session. The durable store, revision fencing, idempotency
receipts, claims, and acceptance protocol are unchanged; only the transport
and liveness evidence differ.

Tracking: sympoies/dsh-runtime-kit#6 (M1). The consuming plugin work is M2 in
that issue.

## Division of responsibility

| Concern | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Run/assignment/checkpoint records, revision fencing, idempotency | `main-agent` (this crate, unchanged) |
| Worker session record + capability/checkpoint file minting | `main-agent worker start` (dsh arm) |
| Spawning the worker agent, delivering the bootstrap prompt | dsh-runtime-kit plugin |
| Per-lane broker heartbeat process | dsh-runtime-kit plugin (spawns `agent-session broker heartbeat`) |
| Liveness/turn evidence | plugin-maintained sidecar file (schema below) |
| Worker-side bootstrap/checkpoint | worker agent runs the existing `main-agent bootstrap` / `main-agent checkpoint` verbs |
| Stop/interrupt of a lane runtime | plugin (`worker stop-runtime` returns a typed refusal for dsh) |

The plugin's ordinary DSH provider hooks may still invoke the shared
`agent-session.activity.v1` policy capability. For an external lane, an event
for the exact active runtime generation is a non-mutating success only when the
sidecar already proves the live turn. The returned state is projected from the
sidecar; no competing activity document is advanced. A stale generation or
unproven sidecar remains a closed failure.

## `capabilities --provider dsh`

`main-agent capabilities --provider dsh --format json` returns
`main-agent.capabilities.v1` with:

- `capabilities.runtime_checkpoint_file`: `"main-agent.runtime-checkpoint-file.v1"`.
- `capabilities.runtime_hook_checkpoint_write`: always `null`. DSH policy v1
  admits only native allow/block decisions; there is no hook checkpoint-write
  admission layer, and none is required — the store fences every checkpoint.
- `capabilities.run_wide_closeout`: `"main-agent.run-wide-closeout.v1"`.
- `capabilities.external_runtime`: `"main-agent.external-runtime.v1"` — the
  worker transport contract in this spec.
- `compatible`: true iff the same-directory sibling `agent-hook` reports a
  doctor record for product `dsh` with `dispatch_supported: true` and
  `registration_owner: "dsh-runtime-kit"`. For codex/claude the existing
  predicate (hook checkpoint-write admission) is unchanged.

## `worker start` external arm

For `launch.agent = "dsh"` the shared path (validation, claims, digests,
replay, assignment record, packet storage, fences) is unchanged. At the
launch boundary the arm diverges:

- The session record is created through the normal record path with
  `runtime.kind = "dsh_external"`, an empty `tmux_session`, and a CLI-minted
  `launch_id` (the worker incarnation). No process is spawned and no prompt
  is pasted.
- `--await-ready` must be `0s`; a non-zero value is `invalid-input`
  (`dsh-await-ready-unsupported`). Readiness is observed with
  `worker wait`/`worker show` after the plugin delivers the prompt; the
  authenticated-checkpoint readiness proof is store-only and unchanged.
- Provider-stop canary, account handoff, and submit-key recovery remain
  codex/claude-only; the existing gates already exclude dsh.
- The result stays `main-agent.worker-start-result.v1` and additionally
  carries (dsh only):

```jsonc
"delivery": { "state": "external-launch-pending", "proof": "external-runtime-transfer" },
"external_launch": {
  "schema_version": "main-agent.external-launch.v1",
  "launch_id": "<runtime.launch_id>",
  "prompt": "<byte-stable dsh bootstrap prompt; contains no environment values>",
  "worker_env": {
    "AGENT_SESSION_ID": "<worker session id>",
    "AGENT_SESSION_STATE_DIR": "<state dir>",
    "AGENT_SESSION_RUNTIME_ID": "<launch_id>",
    "AGENT_SESSION_CAPABILITY_FILE": "<capability path for (session, launch_id)>",
    "AGENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT_FILE": "<checkpoint path for (session, launch_id)>"
  },
  "broker_heartbeat_argv": ["<agent-session bin>", "--state-dir", "<state dir>", "broker", "heartbeat", "--session", "<id>", "--incarnation", "<launch_id>", "--generation", "1", "--capability-file", "<capability path>", "--format", "json"],
  "broker_stop_argv": ["<agent-session bin>", "--state-dir", "<state dir>", "broker", "stop", "--session", "<id>", "--capability-file", "<capability path>", "--format", "json"],
  "liveness_file": "<session dir>/dsh-runtime-liveness.json"
}
```

The plugin must deliver `prompt` verbatim as the worker's initial message,
run `broker_heartbeat_argv` as a supervised background process for the lane's
lifetime, run `broker_stop_argv` at lane end, and arrange the worker's
`main-agent`/`agent-session` invocations to carry `worker_env`. The prompt is
deliberately environment-free so it stays a byte-stable replay contract; env
delivery is a plugin responsibility (per-child instruction context or a
wrapping native tool).

`broker_heartbeat_argv[0]` is the trusted `agent-session` binary, but the verb
is **not** at a fixed index: global options (`--state-dir`, and `--host` where a
host label applies) precede it. A consumer validating the argv must walk past
option/value pairs to find `broker`.

### Coordination-broker lifecycle for a lane

This is the sequence that makes the lane's worker able to authenticate at all,
and each step belongs to exactly one side:

1. **`worker start` provisions the lane's broker** and mints the capability file
   that `worker_env.AGENT_SESSION_CAPABILITY_FILE` and the heartbeat argv both
   name. A tmux worker gets this from its launch path; an external lane has no
   launch of ours, so the external arm provisions it here. Provisioning is
   idempotent for replay: an existing capability for the same incarnation is
   accepted rather than rotated under a running lane.
2. **The plugin publishes the liveness sidecar**, then starts the heartbeat. The
   order matters: the heartbeat's first act is to read this lane's runtime
   evidence, so the sidecar must already exist rather than arrive inside the
   heartbeat's startup retry window.
3. **The heartbeat activates the broker** on its first live beat. Readiness
   cannot be established at step 1 — neither the lane's runtime evidence nor its
   heartbeat exists yet — so the first beat is the earliest provable moment. A
   lane's authenticated calls (starting with `main-agent bootstrap`) fail
   `coordination-unauthorized` until then, which is ordinary startup latency of
   about one heartbeat interval, not an error state.

The dsh prompt is a fifth byte-stable replay variant alongside the four
existing prompts; `ensure_worker_launch_matches` accepts it for replay
matching exactly like the others.

An exact replay that finds the external worker record but not the terminal
worker-start receipt MUST acquire or join the original worker-start authority
fence before committing the assignment attachment. The external and managed
runtime arms share the same revision-1-to-2 attachment helper, so a crash after
record creation cannot leave an unowned fence while another caller commits the
attachment outside it. A conflicting replay is rejected by the existing
request-digest/idempotency contract.

## Liveness sidecar — `main-agent.dsh-runtime-liveness.v1`

Path: `<session dir>/dsh-runtime-liveness.json`, written and refreshed only by
the plugin. The reader requires an owner-only (`0600`-class), single-link,
non-symlink regular file at exactly that path, at most 64 KiB, and rejects
unknown fields at every level. Fields:

```jsonc
{
  "schema_version": "main-agent.dsh-runtime-liveness.v1",
  "launch_id": "<must equal runtime.launch_id>",
  "harness": {
    "pid": <harness pid>,
    // Linux /proc starttime ticks. Required to prove the exact incarnation:
    // without it liveness is undecidable and destructive operations refuse.
    "start_time": <starttime ticks, optional>
  },
  "lane": { "state": "open" | "terminated" },
  // Optional turn evidence; absent means diagnosis degrades conservatively.
  "turn": {
    "phase": "working" | "waiting",
    "phase_changed_at": "<epoch seconds>",
    "current_turn": { "started_at": "<epoch seconds>", "last_progress_at": "<epoch seconds, optional>" },
    "last_turn": { "completed_at": "<epoch seconds>", "outcome": "completed" | "failed" | "interrupted" }
  },
  "updated_at": "<epoch seconds>"
}
```

Consumption. The reader resolves one of four dispositions:

| Disposition | When | `session_status` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| never attached | no sidecar exists | `missing` |
| running | valid sidecar, lane `open`, pinned harness proven live | `running` |
| proven stopped | the pinned harness is proven gone (ESRCH, or a starttime mismatch proving pid reuse) — for a lane reading `open` this is the only proof; or the lane reads `terminated` and this lane's broker heartbeat is absent or stale | `stopped` |
| unproven | sidecar unreadable, malformed, oversized, wrongly owned, or launch-mismatched; the harness state is undecidable (see the platform rule below) with no broker witness available; or the lane reads `terminated` while its own broker heartbeat is still fresh | `unknown` |

Platform rule for the incarnation pin: where a starttime source exists (Linux
`/proc`), a liveness claim without a verified `start_time` match is *undecided*
rather than live, so a recycled pid can never masquerade as a live harness —
including when `kill` reports `EPERM`. On platforms with no starttime source the
pid signal is the only liveness evidence that exists, so it is decisive there
and pid reuse remains an accepted residual risk, exactly as it is for the tmux
process-group probe on the same platforms. Plugins should always write
`start_time` where the platform can read it.

- Destructive operations require positive evidence: record deletion (and the
  `remove-console-record` maintenance action) is admitted only for a
  never-attached or proven-stopped lane. A running lane refuses, and an
  unproven lane refuses with `coordination-runtime-unverified` — a corrupted
  sidecar must never authorize destroying a live lane's record.
- A proven-stopped lane must additionally be corroborated by its coordination
  broker: the sidecar path must be the one this CLI derives for the record, and
  the lane's broker heartbeat must be absent or stale. The sidecar is writable
  by the lane's own worker, so sidecar evidence alone is forgeable; requiring
  the separately maintained heartbeat to be gone means a forged stop must also
  surrender coordination authority, which is itself observable. This raises the
  bar — it is not an OS boundary, and the same-uid caveat above still stands.
- A never-attached lane is terminal for pre-claim recovery: while its
  assignment is still `starting` and holds no claim, `worker cancel` and
  `worker reassign` treat it exactly as they treat a runtime that died during
  startup. Its `missing` status must not be read as "evidence unavailable",
  which would leave the assignment with no recovery route at all.
- An idle-but-resumable lane is *running*: cold resume is always available
  while the harness lives and the lane is open.
- `lane.state == "terminated"` is a **plugin assertion**, deliberately weaker
  than the tmux kernel-backed proof: the sidecar lives in the same-uid state
  dir a lane's own worker can reach. It is therefore never believed on its own.
  Either of two witnesses, each owned by a different process, corroborates it:
  - the pinned harness proven gone, or
  - this lane's own broker heartbeat absent or stale.

  The plugin releases a lane's heartbeat when it closes that lane, so a closed
  lane is provable while the harness keeps serving its other lanes. A lane whose
  heartbeat is still fresh holds the coordination authority a stopped lane gives
  up, so the assertion stays unproven with
  `external dsh lane termination is uncorroborated while its coordination
  heartbeat stays fresh`. A reader with no way to consult the heartbeat (no state
  context on hand) treats the lane exactly as one that still holds authority, so
  a reader that cannot check never widens what is provable.

  **Residual risk, stated exactly.** The heartbeat witness is weaker than the
  harness witness, and knowing how is the point. Both the sidecar and the
  heartbeat process are same-uid, so a hostile lane worker can write a
  `terminated` sidecar and kill its own heartbeat, after which its record is
  deletable while the lane keeps computing. It cannot do the equivalent to the
  harness witness: killing the harness kills the lane with it. What the trade
  costs the attacker is the authority it just surrendered — with a stale broker,
  every authenticated call it makes, `main-agent checkpoint` included, fails
  `coordination-unauthorized`, so the lane can no longer touch the run it was
  hiding from. The exchange is deliberate: it buys a controller the ability to
  reclaim one lane's assignment while its sibling lanes keep working, instead of
  waiting for the whole harness to exit. Coordination remains a same-uid
  boundary, not an OS one, exactly as the caveat above says.
- `coordination_runtime_evidence` builds the runtime identity from `harness`
  (validated against `launch_id`) and reuses the existing process-liveness
  proof. Unproven stays conservative exactly as for tmux runtimes.

## Diagnose/supervise evidence

Store, claim, packet, worktree, and coordination evidence are provider-neutral
and unchanged. For `dsh` workers the activity evidence is derived from the
sidecar instead of the provider hook spool: a valid open lane under a live
harness whose sidecar carries a known `turn.phase` reports that phase with
`source.kind: "runtime"`, `provider: "dsh"`, and authoritative confidence
(the harness observes its own agent directly, so the signal is authoritative
rather than inferred). This projection is the shared one, so every activity
consumer — diagnosis, views, claim gates — reads the same evidence.

Any other state yields no activity evidence, and diagnosis then distinguishes
proven absence from missing evidence: a never-attached or proven-stopped lane
has no turn to report and is classified as *absent* activity, while an unproven
lane is *unavailable* and keeps the fail-closed guards engaged. Classifying a
closed lane as unavailable instead would fence the cancel/reassign routes that
lane needs. The classification table itself is not modified.

## Typed refusals

- `worker stop-runtime`, `worker stop-claimed-runtime`: `dsh-runtime-plugin-owned`
  — the plugin interrupts the lane; `worker reconcile-stopped` then proceeds
  store-side unchanged once the sidecar proves the lane stopped.
- `agent-session start` without a server-owned launch profile, `run`,
  provider-resume import, and `activity setup` refuse before provider launch
  or configuration side effects; external dsh sessions and lifecycle
  configuration are external-runtime owned. Only records created through the
  external path carry `runtime.kind = "dsh_external"`; a dsh pane started
  through a serve launch profile is an ordinary tmux runtime.
- `agent-session resume`/provider resume surfaces: external dsh sessions are
  not CLI-resumable.
- `agent-session delete`, `maintenance` `remove-console-record`: an unproven
  lane refuses with `coordination-runtime-unverified`.

## Closing out an unproven lane

An unproven lane is closed out by producing evidence, never by forcing the
refusal. In order:

1. Ask the owning plugin to publish a fresh sidecar for the recorded launch. A
   plugin that still owns the lane can always re-derive `harness` and
   `lane.state`, which resolves the disposition either way.
2. If the harness is genuinely gone, confirm the recorded pid is not live and
   remove the stale sidecar file. The lane then reads as never attached, which
   is a terminal pre-claim disposition, and the assignment can be cancelled or
   reassigned.
3. If the harness is undecidable because the platform has no starttime source,
   the lane's own broker heartbeat is the remaining evidence: a lane whose
   sidecar reads `terminated` becomes provable as soon as that heartbeat goes
   stale, with no need to stop the harness. A lane whose sidecar still reads
   `open` has no second witness, so there the operator stops the harness process
   and the pid probe decides.

The CLI intentionally offers no force flag for this path. A force flag would be
indistinguishable from the forged-stop case the corroboration rule exists to
prevent, and the recovery above needs no new authority.

## Non-goals (v1)

- No provider hook activity pipeline for dsh (`agent-session activity` events
  may arrive later via the agent-hook DSH ingress work; this spec does not
  depend on it).
- No `AssignmentInput` schema change (worker-start digests must stay stable).
- No provider-stop canary, account handoff, or submit-key recovery for dsh.
