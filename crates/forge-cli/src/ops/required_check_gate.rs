//! Required-check gate used by `pr merge` immediately before the backend
//! invocation. Performs a fresh TTL-zero snapshot through
//! [`pr_checks::snapshot`] and refuses to proceed when any required check is
//! failing or pending.
//!
//! Spec: `crates/forge-cli/docs/specs/forge-cli-spec-v1.md` §"Lock-down policy"
//! rule 8 (`required_checks_green`). Mirrors the
//! `github-pr-required-check-gating` operation record: even when an upstream
//! `pr wait-checks` finished < 1s ago, the gate re-fetches from the provider
//! so stale "all green" answers cannot leak through into a destructive merge.
//!
//! Error surface:
//!
//! | Outcome            | Variant                                       | Exit      |
//! | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------- |
//! | All required pass  | `Ok(PrChecksPayload)`                         | n/a       |
//! | Any required fail  | `Err(checks_failed)` → RuntimeFailure         | RUNTIME 1 |
//! | Else any pending   | `Err(checks_pending)` → Validation            | DATA 65   |
//! | Else nothing ran   | `Err(checks_not_registered)` → Validation     | DATA 65   |
//!
//! Failure dominates pending — if both are present the gate reports
//! `checks_failed` because the spec terminal-state mapping puts failure ahead
//! of pending.
//!
//! # Absence is not success
//!
//! "All required checks passed" is vacuously true over an empty set, so a
//! snapshot with nothing failing, nothing pending, **and nothing passing** used
//! to reach `Ok`. That let a PR satisfy the gate having run no CI at all, which
//! is not hypothetical: `gh pr checks --required` exits non-zero with "no
//! required checks reported" during the provider's check-registration window
//! after a force-with-lease, and [`pr_checks`] deliberately normalizes that into
//! an empty successful snapshot so the read surface can report "nothing is
//! failing" without erroring.
//!
//! Reporting and gating want opposite defaults there. The read surface is right
//! to say "no checks are failing"; the gate must not accept that as proof the
//! head was checked, because the gate exists to establish exactly that. So the
//! empty gating set fails closed here as `checks_not_registered`, while
//! [`pr_checks`] keeps reporting it as `success` — and a repository that
//! genuinely configures no checks opts out per invocation with
//! `--allow-no-checks`.
//!
//! The neighbouring REST fallback already reached this conclusion: when
//! requiredness is unknown and the row set is empty it *synthesizes a pending
//! row* rather than returning an empty pass. This is the same rule applied to
//! the path that reports emptiness honestly.
